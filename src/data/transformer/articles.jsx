              An integral part of any electric grid are its electrical
              transformers. As the name implies, the role of transformer cores
              is to convert or “transform” incoming voltage into a desirable
              outgoing voltage. The energy may be stepped up to higher voltages
              or stepped down to lower voltages. An example of when energy would
              need to be stepped up is when it’s going to travel long distances,
              as this increases the efficiency. Then, as the energy goes from
              the power lines into residential homes, it would be stepped down
              before going into the breaker box. To accomplish these tasks,
              electric transformers can be as large as buildings or as small as
              cellphones.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many important characteristics that should be considered
              when manufacturing transformers. Key among these is reducing
              energy loss occasioned by the energy transfer.

              <strong>About Transformers: The Core</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The center of a transformer is called the core. Here, the
              electricity flows through a primary winding creating a magnetic
              flux. As the magnetic field cuts through the secondary winding,
              the secondary winding picks up the voltage. The power is
              stepped-up or down in relation to the amount of turns of each
              winding. More turns on the secondary winding, and the voltage
              increases. Less turns, and it decreases.

              of transformer cores are shell type and core type. In shell type
              cores, the cores surround the winding. In contrast, core type is
              characterized by the windings surrounding the core, as can be seen
              in the graphic below.

              Core type configurations are used for high voltage/high power
              needs. Although their power losses tend to be higher, the windings
              in core type are readily available and so maintenance is easier
              than in shell type transformers. Finally, because in core type
              transformers the windings are placed on separate legs, more copper
              is required in the manufacturing of core type transformers.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, shell type cores are used for lower power
              applications. They have less energy losses, but maintenance is
              harder because the windings are harder to reach. The better energy
              containment is due to the windings being closer to each other and
              the magnetic flux having a closed path around the coils on which
              to travel. In contrast to the core type, shell type transformers
              allow for natural cooling. The mechanical strength of shell type
              transformers is also higher.

              The coupling, or electromagnetic connection between the two
              windings, must be set up well to prevent loss. In addition, the
              layers of steel that make up the core’s structure should be as
              permeable as possible to conduct the magnetic flux from one
              winding to the other. Stacking layers of thin lamination, rather
              than a core built from one solid piece, has the effect of reducing
              eddy currents and heating.

              Different parts of an electrical transformer are made of different
              materials. Windings are usually made of copper or aluminum, while
              the laminations are made of steel, often silicon steel. Cores can
              also be made of iron, amorphous metals, and ferrite ceramics,
              among others.
            </p>
            <p>
              As efficiency regulations become stricter, demand increases for
              conventional grain-oriented and high permeability electrical
              steels, and worldwide strategic sourcing becomes fundamental. To
              meet these demands, Corefficient has secured sourcing for
              conventional CRGO, HiNB, and laser scribed materials, amongst
              others.

              As the world progresses and focuses on green energy, transformer
              core efficiency no longer becomes just a prospect of saving energy
              and money, but also about creating a sustainable future. With
              renewable energy as the source, the role of transformers is to
              reduce loss as much as possible. With the energy grid becoming
              more decentralized and modern, transformer core design must adapt
              to allow for two-way currents, active energy measurements, and
              energy storage units that will become part of the energy grid.

              to adapt themselves to the new sustainable technologies, new
              synergies are created that improve all transformers. For example,
              new energy efficient transformer cores are being developed that do
              not need maintenance so that they can be installed as underwater
              transformers. These new core designs, propelled by the need for
              better underwater transformers, will eventually reduce the
              maintenance needed on cores everywhere.

              Transformers are electrical devices consisting of two or more
              coils of wire used to transfer electrical energy by means of a
              changing magnetic field

            In this tutorial about transformer basics, we will se that a
            transformer has no internal moving parts, and are typically used
            because a change in voltage is required to transfer energy from one
            circuit to another by electromagnetic induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the main reasons that we use alternating AC voltages and
            currents in our homes and workplace’s is that AC supplies can be
            easily generated at a convenient voltage, transformed (hence the
            name transformer) into much higher voltages and then distributed
            around the country using a national grid of pylons and cables over
            very long distances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for transforming the voltage to a much higher level is
            that higher distribution voltages implies lower currents for the
            same power and therefore lower I<sup>2</sup>*R losses along the
            networked grid of cables. These higher AC transmission voltages and
            currents can then be reduced to a much lower, safer and usable
            voltage level where it can be used to supply electrical equipment in
            our homes and workplaces, and all this is possible thanks to the
            transformer basics of the <strong>Voltage Transformer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Voltage Transformer</strong> can be thought of as an
            electrical component rather than an electronic component. A
            transformer basically is very simple static (or stationary)
            electro-magnetic passive electrical device that works on the
            principle of Faraday’s law of induction by converting electrical
            energy from one value to another.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transformer does this by linking together two or more electrical
            circuits using a common oscillating magnetic circuit which is
            produced by the transformer itself. A transformer basics operate on
            the principals of “electromagnetic induction”, in the form of Mutual
            Induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mutual induction is the process by which a coil of wire magnetically
            induces a voltage into another coil located in close proximity to
            it. Then we can say that transformers work in the “magnetic domain”,
            and transformers get their name from the fact that they “transform”
            one voltage or current level into another.

          <p>
            Transformers are capable of either increasing or decreasing the
            voltage and current levels of their supply, without modifying its
            frequency, or the amount of electrical power being transferred from
            one winding to another via the magnetic circuit.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single phase voltage transformer basically consists of two
            electrical coils of wire, one called the “Primary Winding” and
            another called the “Secondary Winding”. For this tutorial we will
            define the “primary” side of the transformer as the side that
            usually takes power, and the “secondary” as the side that usually
            delivers power. In a single-phase voltage transformer the primary is
            usually the side with the higher voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
            These two coils are not in electrical contact with each other but
            are instead wrapped together around a common closed magnetic iron
            circuit called the “core”. This soft iron core is not solid but made
            up of individual laminations connected together to help reduce the
            core’s magnetic losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary and secondary windings are electrically isolated from
            each other but are magnetically linked through the common core
            allowing electrical power to be transferred from one coil to the
            other. When an electric current passed through the primary winding,
            a magnetic field is developed which induces a voltage into the
            secondary winding and this transformer basics operating principle
            shown below.

            In other words, for a transformer there is no direct electrical
            connection between the two coil windings, thereby giving it the name
            also of an <strong>Isolation Transformer</strong>. Generally, the
            primary winding of a transformer is connected to the input voltage
            supply and converts or transforms the electrical power into a
            magnetic field. While the job of the secondary winding is to convert
            this alternating magnetic field into electrical power producing the
            required output voltage as shown.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Notice that the two coil windings are not electrically connected but
            are only linked magnetically. A single-phase transformer can operate
            to either increase or decrease the voltage applied to the primary
            winding.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a transformer is used to “increase” the voltage on its
            secondary winding with respect to the primary, it is called a{" "}
            <strong>Step-up transformer</strong>. When it is used to “decrease”
            the voltage on the secondary winding with respect to the primary it
            is called a <strong>Step-down transformer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a third condition exists in which a transformer produces
            the same voltage on its secondary as is applied to its primary
            winding. In other words, its output is identical with respect to
            voltage, current and power transferred. This type of transformer is
            called an “Impedance Transformer” and is mainly used for impedance
            matching or the isolation of adjoining electrical circuits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference in voltage between the primary and the secondary
            windings is achieved by changing the number of coil turns in the
            primary winding (&nbsp;N<sub>P</sub>&nbsp;) compared to the number
            of coil turns on the secondary winding (&nbsp;N<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;).
          </p>
          <p>
            As the transformer is basically a linear device, a ratio now exists
            between the number of turns of the primary coil divided by the
            number of turns of the secondary coil. This ratio, called the ratio
            of transformation, more commonly known as a transformers “turns
            ratio”, (&nbsp;TR&nbsp;). This turns ratio value dictates the
            operation of the transformer and the corresponding voltage available
            on the secondary winding.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is necessary to know the ratio of the number of turns of wire on
            the primary winding compared to the secondary winding. The turns
            ratio, which has no units, compares the two windings in order and is
            written with a colon, such as 3:1 (3-to-1).
          </p>
          <p>
            This means in this example, that if there are 3 volts on the primary
            winding there will be 1 volt on the secondary winding, 3 volts-to-1
            volt. Then we can see that if the ratio between the number of turns
            changes the resulting voltages must also change by the same ratio,
            and this is true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transformers are all about “ratios”. The ratio of the primary to the
            secondary, the ratio of the input to the output, and the turns ratio
            of any given transformer will be the same as its voltage ratio. In
            other words for a transformer: “turns ratio = voltage ratio”. The
            actual number of turns of wire on any winding is generally not
            important, just the turns ratio and this relationship is given as:

            Note that the order of the numbers when expressing a transformers{" "}
            <em>turns ratio</em> value is very important as the turns ratio 3:1

          <p>
            This ratio of 3:1 (3-to-1) simply means that there are three primary
            windings for every one secondary winding. As the ratio moves from a
            larger number on the left to a smaller number on the right, the
            primary voltage is therefore stepped down in value as shown.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Basics Example No2</h2>
          <p>
            If 240 volts rms is applied to the primary winding of the same
            transformer above, what will be the resulting secondary no load
            voltage.

          </p>
          <p>
            Again confirming that the transformer is a “step-down” transformer
            as the primary voltage is 240 volts and the corresponding secondary
            voltage is lower at 80 volts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the main purpose of a transformer is to transform voltages at
            preset ratios and we can see that the primary winding has a set
            amount or number of windings (coils of wire) on it to suit the input
            voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the secondary output voltage is to be the same value as the input
            voltage on the primary winding, then the same number of coil turns
            must be wound onto the secondary core as there are on the primary
            core giving an even turns ratio of 1:1 (1-to-1). In other words, one
            coil turn on the secondary to one coil turn on the primary.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the output secondary voltage is to be greater or higher than the
            input voltage, (step-up transformer) then there must be more turns
            on the secondary giving a turns ratio of 1:N (1-to-N), where N
            represents the turns ratio number. Likewise, if it is required that
            the secondary voltage is to be lower or less than the primary,
            (step-down transformer) then the number of secondary windings must
            be less giving a turns ratio of N:1 (N-to-1).
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Action</h2>
          <p>
            We have seen that the number of coil turns on the secondary winding
            compared to the primary winding, the turns ratio, affects the amount
            of voltage available from the secondary coil. But if the two
            windings are electrically isolated from each other, how is this
            secondary voltage produced?
          </p>
          <p>
            We have said previously that a transformer basically consists of two
            coils wound around a common soft iron core. When an alternating
            voltage (&nbsp;V
            <sub>P</sub>&nbsp;) is applied to the primary coil, current flows
            through the coil which in turn sets up a magnetic field around
            itself. This effect is called <em>mutual inductance</em> according
            to <em>Faraday’s Law</em> of electromagnetic induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strength of the magnetic field builds up as the current flow
            rises from zero to its maximum value which is given as dΦ/dt.
          </p>
          <div>
            <img
              title="Transformer Basics of Flux Linkage"
              src="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/transformer-trans5.gif"
              alt="transformer basics of flux linkage"
              width={328}
              height={134}
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            As the magnetic lines of force setup by this electromagnet expand
            outward from the coil the soft iron core forms a path for and
            concentrates the magnetic flux. This magnetic flux links the turns
            of both windings as it increases and decreases in opposite
            directions under the influence of the AC supply.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the strength of the magnetic field induced into the soft
            iron core depends upon the amount of current and the number of turns
            in the winding. When current is reduced, the magnetic field strength
            reduces.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the magnetic lines of flux flow around the core, they pass
            through the turns of the secondary winding, causing a voltage to be
            induced into the secondary coil. The amount of voltage induced will
            be determined by: N*dΦ/dt (Faraday’s Law), where N is the number of
            coil turns. Also this induced voltage has the same frequency as the
            primary winding voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we can see that the same voltage is induced in each coil turn
            of both windings because the same magnetic flux links the turns of
            both the windings together. As a result, the total induced voltage
            in each winding is directly proportional to the number of turns in
            that winding. However, the peak amplitude of the output voltage
            available on the secondary winding will be reduced if the magnetic
            losses of the core are high.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want the primary coil to produce a stronger magnetic field to
            overcome the cores magnetic losses, we can either send a larger
            current through the coil, or keep the same current flowing, and
            instead increase the number of coil turns (&nbsp;N<sub>P</sub>
            &nbsp;) of the winding. The product of amperes times turns is called
            the “ampere-turns”, which determines the magnetising force of the
            coil.
          </p>
          <p>
            So assuming we have a transformer with a single turn in the primary,
            and only one turn in the secondary. If one volt is applied to the
            one turn of the primary coil, assuming no losses, enough current
            must flow and enough magnetic flux generated to induce one volt in
            the single turn of the secondary. That is, each winding supports the
            same number of volts per turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the magnetic flux varies sinusoidally, Φ&nbsp;=&nbsp;Φ
            <sub>max</sub> sinωt, then the basic relationship between induced
            emf, (&nbsp;E&nbsp;) in a coil winding of N turns is given by:

          <p>
            This is known as the <strong>Transformer EMF Equation</strong>. For
            the primary winding emf, N will be the number of primary turns,
            (&nbsp;N
            <sub>P</sub>&nbsp;) and for the secondary winding emf, N will be the
            number of secondary turns, (&nbsp;N<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;).
          </p>
          <p>
            Also please note that as transformers require an alternating
            magnetic flux to operate correctly, transformers cannot therefore be
            used to transform or supply DC voltages or currents, since the
            magnetic field must be changing to induce a voltage in the secondary
            winding. In other words,{" "}
            <strong>
              transformers DO NOT operate on steady state DC voltages
            </strong>
            , only alternating or pulsating voltages.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a transformers primary winding was connected to a DC supply, the
            inductive reactance of the winding would be zero as DC has no
            frequency, so the effective impedance of the winding will therefore
            be very low and equal only to the resistance of the copper used.
            Thus the winding will draw a very high current from the DC supply
            causing it to overheat and eventually burn out, because as we know
            I&nbsp;=&nbsp;V/R.

          <h2>Electrical Power in a Transformer</h2>
          <p>
            Another one of the transformer basics parameters is its power
            rating. The power rating of a transformer is obtained by simply
            multiplying the current by the voltage to obtain a rating in{" "}
            <strong>Volt-amperes</strong>, (&nbsp;VA&nbsp;). Small single phase
            transformers may be rated in volt-amperes only, but much larger
            power transformers are rated in units of{" "}
            <strong>Kilo volt-amperes</strong>, (&nbsp;kVA&nbsp;) where 1 kilo
            volt-ampere is equal to 1,000 volt-amperes, and units of{" "}
            <strong>Mega volt-amperes</strong>, (&nbsp;MVA&nbsp;) where 1 mega
            volt-ampere is equal to 1 million volt-amperes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an ideal transformer (ignoring any losses), the power available
            in the secondary winding will be the same as the power in the
            primary winding, they are constant wattage devices and do not change
            the power only the voltage to current ratio. Thus, in an ideal
            transformer the <strong>Power Ratio</strong> is equal to one (unity)
            as the voltage, V multiplied by the current, I will remain constant.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the electric power at one voltage/current level on the
            primary is “transformed” into electric power, at the same frequency,
            to the same voltage/current level on the secondary side. Although
            the transformer can step-up (or step-down) voltage, it cannot
            step-up power. Thus, when a transformer steps-up a voltage, it
            steps-down the current and vice-versa, so that the output power is
            always at the same value as the input power. Then we can say that
            primary power equals secondary power, (&nbsp;P
            <sub>P</sub>
            &nbsp;=&nbsp;P<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;).

            Note that since power loss is proportional to the square of the
            current being transmitted, that is: I<sup>2</sup>R, increasing the
            voltage, let’s say doubling (&nbsp;×2&nbsp;) the voltage would
            decrease the current by the same amount, (&nbsp;÷2&nbsp;) while
            delivering the same amount of power to the load and therefore
            reducing losses by factor of 4. If the voltage was increased by a
            factor of 10, the current would decrease by the same factor reducing
            overall losses by factor of 100.

          <h2>Transformer Basics – Efficiency</h2>
          <p>
            A transformer does not require any moving parts to transfer energy.
            This means that there are no friction or windage losses associated
            with other electrical machines. However, transformers do suffer from
            other types of losses called “copper losses” and “iron losses” but
            generally these are quite small.
          </p>
          <p>
            Copper losses, also known as I<sup>2</sup>R loss is the electrical
            power which is lost in heat as a result of circulating the currents
            around the transformers copper windings, hence the name. Copper
            losses represents the greatest loss in the operation of a
            transformer. The actual watts of power lost can be determined (in
            each winding) by squaring the amperes and multiplying by the
            resistance in ohms of the winding (I<sup>2</sup>
            R).
          </p>
          <p>
            Iron losses, also known as hysteresis is the lagging of the magnetic
            molecules within the core, in response to the alternating magnetic
            flux. This lagging (or out-of-phase) condition is due to the fact
            that it requires power to reverse magnetic molecules; they do not
            reverse until the flux has attained sufficient force to reverse
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their reversal results in friction, and friction produces heat in
            the core which is a form of power loss. Hysteresis within the
            transformer can be reduced by making the core from special steel
            alloys.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intensity of power loss in a transformer determines its
            efficiency. The efficiency of a transformer is reflected in power
            (wattage) loss between the primary (input) and secondary (output)
            windings. Then the resulting efficiency of a transformer is equal to
            the ratio of the power output of the secondary winding, P
            <sub>S</sub> to the power input of the primary winding, P
            <sub>P</sub> and is therefore high.
          </p>
          <p>
            An ideal transformer would be 100% efficient, passing all the
            electrical energy it receives on its primary side to its secondary
            side. But real transformers on the other hand are not 100%
            efficient. When operating at full load capacity their maximum
            efficiency is nearer 94% to 96%, which is still quite good for an
            electrical device. For a transformer operating at a constant AC
            voltage and frequency its efficiency can be as high as 98%. The
            efficiency, η of a transformer is given as:

            Generally when dealing with transformers, the primary watts are
            called “volt-amps”, <strong>VA</strong> to differentiate them from
            the secondary watts. Then the efficiency equation above can be
            modified to:

            When learning about transformer basics, it is sometimes easier to
            remember the relationship between the transformers input, output and
            efficiency by using pictures. Here the three quantities of VA, W and
            η have been superimposed into a triangle giving power in watts at
            the top with volt-amps and efficiency at the bottom. This
            arrangement represents the actual position of each quantity in the
            efficiency formulas.

          <h2>Transformer Basics Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Then to summarise this transformer basics tutorial. A{" "}
            <strong>Transformer</strong> changes the voltage level (or current
            level) on its input winding to another value on its output winding
            using a magnetic field. A transformer consists of two electrically
            isolated coils and operates on Faraday’s principal of “mutual
            induction”, in which an EMF is induced in the transformers secondary
            coil by the magnetic flux generated by the voltages and currents
            flowing in the primary coil winding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the primary and secondary coil windings are wrapped around a
            common soft iron core made of individual laminations to reduce eddy
            current and power losses. The primary winding of the transformer is
            connected to the AC power source which must be sinusoidal in nature,
            while the secondary winding supplies electrical power to the load.
            Having said that, a transformer could be used in reverse with the
            supply connected to the secondary winding provided the voltage and
            current ratings are observed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can represent this transformer basics in block diagram form as
            follows:

          <p>
            The ratio of the transformers primary and secondary windings with
            respect to each other produces either a step-up voltage transformer
            or a step-down voltage transformer with the ratio between the number
            of primary turns to the number of secondary turns being called the
            “turns ratio” or “transformer ratio”.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this ratio is less than unity, n&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1 then N
            <sub>S</sub> is greater than N<sub>P</sub> and the transformer is
            classed as a step-up transformer. If this ratio is greater than
            unity, n&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1, that is N<sub>P</sub> is greater than N
            <sub>S</sub>, the transformer is classed as a step-down transformer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that single phase step-down transformer can also be used as a
            step-up transformer simply by reversing its connections and making
            the low voltage winding its primary, and vice versa as long as the
            transformer is operated within its original VA design rating.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the turns ratio is equal to unity, that is n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, then
            both the primary and secondary have the same number of coil turns so
            therefore the voltages and currents will be the same for both the
            primary and secondary windings.
          </p>
          <p>
            This type of 1:1 transformer is classed as an isolation transformer
            as both the primary and secondary windings of the transformer have
            the same number of volts per turn. The efficiency of a transformer
            is the ratio of the power it delivers to the load to the power it
            absorbs from the supply. In an ideal transformer there are no losses
            so no loss of power then P<sub>IN</sub> = P<sub>OUT</sub>.

            and see the different magnetic core types and laminations used to
            support the primary and secondary windings.

          <p>
            A transformer construction provides a magnetic circuit, known more
            commonly as the “transformer core”, which is designed to provide a
            path for the magnetic field to flow around. This magnetic path is
            necessary for the induction of voltage between the two input and
            output windings.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this type of <strong>transformer construction</strong>{" "}
            where the two windings are wound on separate limbs is not very
            efficient since the primary and secondary windings are well
            separated from each other. This results in a low magnetic coupling
            between the two windings as well as large amounts of magnetic flux
            leakage from the transformer itself. But as well as this “O” shapes
            construction, there are different types of “transformer
            construction” and designs available which are used to overcome these
            inefficiencies producing a smaller more compact transformer.

          <p>
            The efficiency of a simple transformer construction can be improved
            by bringing the two windings within close contact with each other
            thereby improving the magnetic coupling. Increasing and
            concentrating the magnetic circuit around the coils may improve the
            magnetic coupling between the two windings, but it also has the
            effect of increasing the magnetic losses of the transformer core.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as providing a low reluctance path for the magnetic field,
            the core is designed to prevent circulating electric currents within
            the iron core itself. Circulating currents, called “eddy currents”,
            cause heating and energy losses within the core decreasing the
            transformer’s efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            These losses are due mainly to voltages induced in the iron circuit,
            which is constantly being subjected to the alternating magnetic
            fields setup by the external sinusoidal supply voltage. One way to
            reduce these unwanted power losses is to construct the transformer
            core from thin steel laminations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most types of transformer construction, the central iron core is
            constructed from of a highly permeable material commonly made from
            thin silicon steel laminations. These thin laminations are assembled
            together to provide the required magnetic path with the minimum of
            magnetic losses. The resistivity of the steel sheet itself is high,
            thus reducing any eddy current loss by making the laminations very
            thin.
          </p>
          <p>
            These steel transformer laminations vary in thickness’s from between
            0.25mm to 0.5mm and as steel is a conductor, the laminations and any
            fixing studs, rivets or bolts are electrically insulated from each
            other by a very thin coating of insulating varnish or by the use of
            an oxide layer on the surface.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Construction of the Core</h2>
          <p>
            Generally, the name associated with the construction of a
            transformer is dependent upon how the primary and secondary windings
            are wound around the central laminated steel core. The two most
            common and basic designs of transformer construction are the{" "}
            <strong>Closed-core Transformer</strong> and the{" "}
            <strong>Shell-core Transformer</strong>.
          </p>
          <div></div>
          <p>
            In the “closed-core” type (core form) transformer, the primary and
            secondary windings are wound outside and surround the core ring. In
            the “shell type” (shell form) transformer, the primary and secondary
            windings pass inside the steel magnetic circuit (core) which forms a
            shell around the windings as shown below.

            In both types of transformer core design, the magnetic flux linking
            the primary and secondary windings travels entirely within the core
            with no loss of magnetic flux through air. In the core type
            transformer construction, one half of the winding is wrapped around
            each leg (or limb) of the transformer’s magnetic circuit as shown
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            The coils are not arranged with the primary winding on one leg and
            the secondary on the other but instead half of the primary winding
            and half of the secondary winding are placed one over the other
            concentrically on each leg in order to increase magnetic coupling
            allowing practically all of the magnetic lines of force go through
            both the primary and secondary windings at the same time. However,
            with this type of transformer construction, a small percentage of
            the magnetic lines of force flow outside of the core, and this is
            called “leakage flux”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shell type transformer core’s overcome this leakage flux as both the
            primary and secondary windings are wound on the same centre leg or
            limb which has twice the cross-sectional area of the two outer
            limbs. The advantage here is that the magnetic flux has two closed
            magnetic paths to flow around external to the coils on both left and
            right hand sides before returning back to the central coils.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that the magnetic flux circulating around the outer limbs
            of this type of transformer construction is equal to Φ/2. As the
            magnetic flux has a closed path around the coils, this has the
            advantage of decreasing core losses and increasing overall
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Laminations</h2>
          <p>
            But you may be wondering as to how the primary and secondary
            windings are wound around these laminated iron or steel cores for
            this types of transformer constructions. The coils are firstly wound
            on a former which has a cylindrical, rectangular or oval type cross
            section to suit the construction of the laminated core. In both the
            shell and core type transformer constructions, in order to mount the
            coil windings, the individual laminations are stamped or punched out
            from larger steel sheets and formed into strips of thin steel
            resembling the letters “E”s, “L”s, “U”s and “I”s as shown below.
          </p>
          <h3>Transformer Core Types</h3>

          </p>
          <p>
            These lamination stampings when connected together form the required
            core shape. For example, two “E” stampings plus two end closing “I”
            stampings to give an E-I core forming one element of a standard
            shell-type transformer core. These individual laminations are
            tightly butted together during it’s construction to reduce the
            reluctance of the air gap at the joints producing a highly saturated
            magnetic flux density.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transformer core laminations are usually stacked alternately to each
            other to produce an overlapping joint with more lamination pairs
            being added to make up the correct core thickness. This alternate
            stacking of the laminations also gives the transformer the advantage
            of reduced flux leakage and iron losses. E-I core laminated
            transformer construction is mostly used in isolation transformer’s,
            step-up and step-down transformer’s as well as the auto transformer.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Winding Arrangements</h2>
          <p>
            Transformer windings form another important part of a transformer
            construction, because they are the main current-carrying conductors
            wound around the laminated sections of the core. In a single-phase
            two winding transformer, two windings would be present as shown. The
            one which is connected to the voltage source and creates the
            magnetic flux called the primary winding, and the second winding
            called the secondary in which a voltage is induced as a result of
            mutual induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the secondary output voltage is less than that of the primary
            input voltage the transformer is known as a “Step-down Transformer”.
            If the secondary output voltage is greater than the primary input
            voltage it is called a “Step-up Transformer”.

            <p>Core-type Construction</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The type of wire used as the main current carrying conductor in a
            transformer winding is either copper or aluminium. While aluminium
            wire is lighter and generally less expensive than copper wire, a
            larger cross sectional area of conductor must be used to carry the
            same amount of current as with copper so it is used mainly in larger
            power transformer applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Small kVA power and voltage transformers used in low voltage
            electrical and electronic circuits tend to use copper conductors as
            these have a higher mechanical strength and smaller conductor size
            than equivalent aluminium types. The downside is that when complete
            with their core, these transformers can be much heavier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transformer windings and coils can be broadly classified in to
            concentric coils and sandwiched coils. In core-type transformer
            construction, the windings are usually arranged concentrically
            around the core limb as shown above with the higher voltage primary
            winding being wound over the lower voltage secondary winding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sandwiched or “pancake” coils consist of flat conductors wound in a
            spiral form and are so named due to the arrangement of conductors
            into discs. Alternate discs are made to spiral from outside towards
            the centre in an interleaved arrangement with individual coils being
            stacked together and separated by insulating materials such as paper
            of plastic sheet. Sandwich coils and windings are more common with
            shell type core construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Helical Windings</strong> also known as screw windings are
            another very common cylindrical coil arrangement used in low voltage
            high current transformer applications. The windings are made up of
            large cross sectional rectangular conductors wound on its side with
            the insulated strands wound in parallel continuously along the
            length of the cylinder, with suitable spacers inserted between
            adjacent turns or discs to minimize circulating currents between the
            parallel strands. The coil progresses outwards as a helix resembling
            that of a corkscrew.

            <p>Transformer Core</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The insulation used to prevent the conductors shorting together in a
            transformer is usually a thin layer of varnish or enamel in an air
            cooled transformer. This thin varnish or enamel paint is painted
            onto the wire before it is wound around the core.
          </p>
          <p>
            In larger power and distribution type transformer’s, the conductors
            are insulated from each other using oil impregnated paper or cloth.
            The whole core and windings is immersed and sealed in a protective
            tank containing transformer oil. The transformer oil acts as an
            insulator and also as a coolant.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Dot Orientation</h2>
          <p>
            We cannot just simply take a laminated core and wrap one of the coil
            configurations around it. We could but we may find that the
            secondary voltage and current may be out-of-phase with that of the
            primary voltage and current. The two coil windings do have a
            distinct orientation of one with respect to the other. Either coil
            could be wound around the core clockwise or anticlockwise so to keep
            track of their relative orientations “dots” are used to identify a
            given end of each winding.
          </p>
          <p>
            This method of identifying the orientation or wound direction of a
            transformer is called the “dot convention”. Then the windings of a
            transformer are wound so that the correct phase relations exist
            between the winding voltages with the transformer’s polarity being
            defined as the relative polarity of the secondary voltage with
            respect to the primary voltage as shown below.
          </p>
          <h3>Transformer Construction using Dot Orientation</h3>
          <p>
            <img
              title="Transformer Construction Using Dot Orientation"
              src="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/transformer-trans15a.gif"
              alt="construction using dot orientation"
              width={439}

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The first transformer shows its two “dots” side by side on the two
            windings. The current leaving the secondary dot is “in-phase” with
            the current entering the primary side dot. Thus the polarities of
            the voltages at the dotted ends are also in-phase so when the
            voltage is positive at the dotted end of the primary coil, the
            voltage across the secondary coil is also positive at the dotted
            end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second transformer shows the two dots at opposite ends of the
            windings which means that the primary and secondary coil windings of
            the transformer are wound in opposite directions. The result of this
            is that the current leaving the secondary dot is 180<sup>o</sup>{" "}
            “out-of-phase” with the current entering the primary dot. So the
            polarities of the voltages at the dotted ends are also out-of-phase
            so when the voltage is positive at the dotted end of the primary
            coil, the voltage across the corresponding secondary coil will be
            negative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the construction of a transformer can be such that the
            secondary voltage may be either “in-phase” or “out-of-phase” with
            respect to the primary voltage. Transformer’s that have a number of
            different secondary windings that are electrically isolated from
            each other, it is important to know the dot polarity of each
            secondary windings so that they can be connected together in
            series-aiding (secondary voltage is summed) or series-opposing (the
            secondary voltage is the difference) configurations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to adjust the turns ratio of a transformer is often
            desirable to compensate for the effects of variations in the primary
            supply voltage, the regulation of the transformer or varying load
            conditions. Voltage control of the transformer is generally
            performed by changing the turns ratio and therefore its voltage
            ratio whereby a part of the primary winding on the high voltage side
            is tapped out allowing for easy adjustment. The tapping is preferred
            on the high voltage side as the volts per turn are lower than the
            low voltage secondary side.
          </p>
          <h3>Transformer Primary Tap Changes</h3>
          <p>
            <img
              title="Transformer Primary Tap Change"

              alt="primary tap change"
              width={269}
              height={173}
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            In this simple example, the primary tap changes are calculated for a
            supply voltage change of ±5%, but any value can be chosen. Some
            transformer’s may have two or more primary or two or more secondary
            windings for use in different applications providing different
            voltages from a single core.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Construction – Core Losses</h2>
          <p>
            The ability of iron or steel to carry magnetic flux is much greater
            than it is in air, and this ability to allow magnetic flux to flow
            is called <strong>permeability</strong>. Most transformer cores are
            constructed from low carbon steels which can have a permeability in
            the order of 1500 compared with just 1.0 for air.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that a steel laminated core can carry a magnetic flux
            1500 times better than that of air. However, when a magnetic flux
            flows in the steel core of a transformer, two types of losses occur
            within the steel. One termed “eddy current losses” and the other one
            termed “hysteresis losses”.
          </p>
          <h3>Hysteresis Losses</h3>
          <p>
            Transformer Hysteresis Losses are caused because of the friction of
            the molecules against the flow of the magnetic lines of force
            required to magnetise the core, which are constantly changing in
            value and direction first in one direction and then the other due to
            the influence of the sinusoidal supply voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
            This molecular friction causes heat to be developed which represents
            an energy loss to the transformer. Excessive heat loss can overtime
            shorten the life of the insulating materials used in the manufacture
            of the windings and structures. Therefore, cooling of a transformer
            is important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, transformer’s are designed to operate at a particular supply
            frequency. Lowering the frequency of the supply will result in
            increased hysteresis and higher temperature in the iron core. So
            reducing the supply frequency from 60 Hertz to 50 Hertz will raise
            the amount of hysteresis present, decreased the VA capacity of the
            transformer.
          </p>
          <h3>Eddy Current Losses</h3>
          <p>
            Transformer Eddy Current Losses on the other hand are caused by the
            flow of circulating currents induced into the steel caused by the
            flow of the magnetic flux around the core. These circulating
            currents are generated because to the magnetic flux the core is
            acting like a single loop of wire. Since the iron core is a good
            conductor, the eddy currents induced by a solid iron core will be
            large.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eddy currents do not contribute anything towards the usefulness of
            the transformer but instead they oppose the flow of the induced
            current by acting like a negative force generating resistive heating
            and power loss within the core.
          </p>
          <h3>Laminating the Iron Core</h3>
          <div>
            <img
              title="Transformer Laminated Iron Core"

              alt="laminated iron core"
              width={251}

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Eddy current losses within a transformer core cannot be eliminated
            completely, but they can be greatly reduced and controlled by
            reducing the thickness of the steel core. Instead of having one big
            solid iron core as the magnetic core material of the transformer or
            coil, the magnetic path is split up into many thin pressed steel
            shapes called “laminations”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The laminations used in a transformer construction are very thin
            strips of insulated metal joined together to produce a solid but
            laminated core as we saw above. These laminations are insulated from
            each other by a coat of varnish or paper to increase the effective
            resistivity of the core thereby increasing the overall resistance to
            limit the flow of the eddy currents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result of all this insulation is that the unwanted induced eddy
            current power-loss in the core is greatly reduced, and it is for
            this reason why the magnetic iron circuit of every transformer and
            other electro-magnetic machines are all laminated. Using laminations
            in a transformer construction reduces eddy current losses.
          </p>
          <h2>Transformer Construction – Copper Losses</h2>
          <p>
            The losses of energy, which appears as heat due both to hysteresis
            and to eddy currents in the magnetic path, is known commonly as
            “transformer core losses”. Since these losses occur in all magnetic
            materials as a result of alternating magnetic fields. Transformer
            core losses will always be present in a transformer whenever the
            primary winding is energized, even if there is no load connected to
            the secondary winding. Also, the combination of hysteresis and eddy
            current losses are commonly referred to as “transformer iron
            losses”, as the magnetic flux causing these losses is constant at
            all loads.
          </p>
          <h3>Copper Losses</h3>
          <p>
            But there is also another type of energy loss associated with the
            transformer called “copper losses”. Transformer{" "}
            <strong>Copper Losses</strong> are mainly due to the electrical
            resistance of the primary and secondary windings. Most transformer
            coils are wound using copper wire which has a resistive value in
            Ohms (&nbsp;Ω&nbsp;), and as we know from Ohms Law, the copper
            wire’s resistance will oppose any magnetising currents flowing
            through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an electrical load is connected to the secondary winding of a
            transformer, large electrical currents start to flow in both the
            primary and the secondary windings, electrical energy and power
            (&nbsp;the I<sup>2</sup>
            &nbsp;R&nbsp;) losses occur as heat. Generally copper losses vary
            with the load current, being almost zero at no-load, and at a
            maximum at full-load when current flow is at maximum.
          </p>
          <p>
            A volt-amperes (VA) rating of a transformer can be increased by
            better design and construction in order to reduce these core and
            copper losses. A transformer with high voltage and current ratings
            require conductors of large cross-section to help minimise their
            copper losses. Increasing the rate of heat dissipation (better
            cooling) by forced air or oil, or by improving it’s insulation so
            that it can withstand higher temperatures, thereby increasing the VA
            rating of the transformer.

          <p>Then we can define an ideal transformer as having:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No Hysteresis loops or Hysteresis losses →&nbsp;0</li>
            <li>
              Infinite Resistivity of core material giving zero Eddy current
              losses →&nbsp;0
            </li>
            <li>
              Zero winding resistance giving zero I<sup>2</sup>*R copper losses
              →&nbsp;0
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the next tutorial about <strong>Transformer’s</strong> we will
            look at <em>Transformer Loading</em> of the secondary winding with
            respect to an electrical load and see the effect a “NO-load” and a
            “ON-load” connected transformer has on the primary winding current.
